# Seed Backup
This section will demonstrate how to backup the master seed generated on the SeedSigner. There are two ways to backup this information: as a mnemonic phrase or as a QR code. A combination of these two methods can be used for redundant backups. Both the mnemonic phrase and the QR code can be transcribed visually from the SeedSigner display without having to connect the SeedSigner to any device to transfer the information. This keeps the SeedSigner completely air gapped while exporting the master seed. The information transcribed can be to an included paper card or to a stainless steel QR code plate, available from [Vulcan21](https://vulcan21.com/steelqr/).
