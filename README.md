## The Importance of Self-Custody
Before diving into the project, understanding the context for self-custody is a critical aspect of mitigating some of the most pervasive risks involved with Bitcoin, as the saying goes: "Not your keys, not your coins". Trusting third parties like exchanges with your bitcoin introduces several risks that have the potential to leave you vulnerable to theft, seizure, and unrealized capital gains tax. 

Additionally, most custodians, if not all of them, are required to comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations that introduce you to even more risks associated with data breaches that leak your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the wide open internet. All Bitcoin transactions are public and if your PII is tied to on-chain data then you are left with no privacy against the trusted custodian who knows your identity and your on-chain balances, these custodians prioritize their relationship with law enforcement and will always make decisions that do not have your best interest in mind.

Many of these risks can be mitigated by taking self-custody. The tradeoff is that you are taking the personal responsibility of securing your bitcoin. You and you alone are responsible for your bitcoin. There are no "1-800" help lines to reverse your transaction and nobody can help you recover a lost or forgotten seed phrase. Luckily there are many tools available to help you achieve safe and private self-custody. SeedSigner is one such tool that combines general-purpose, inexspensive hardware with free and open source software to provide you with a DIY signing device so you maintain unrestricted, permissionless access to your bitcoin.
